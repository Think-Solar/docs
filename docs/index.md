# Introduction

## What is Think Solar Suite?
Think Solar suite is a multi-tenant application designed to manage solar panel installations from sales right through to project completion.


All branches of the Think Solar franchise will use this application to keep track of business state, by storing consistent data we can provide an essential breakdown as well as an overview of employee, project and the business status as a whole.


We achieve this by pushing each sales lead through a pipeline of stages and populating data at every stage.
